                <p>MY BAG IS FINALLY HEREEEEEE!!!!</p>
                <p>The bag that I've been waiting on, the newest addition to my puppy-themed stuff collection, is HERE!!! I'M SO HAPPY!!!! In <a target="_blank" href="/blog/12-07-2024.html">my last entry</a>, I mentioned that it ran into a problem, and to be fair, it did! The one I ordered then apparently got damaged and had to be sent back :(((( however!! I got a refund and I was desperate, so I ordered it again, and IT'S HERE!!!!!!!</p>
                <div class="twosides">
                    <p class="left">The fabric is shinier than I imagined it being, and it's MUCH more spacious than I expected?? It easily fit everything I had in my old bag, and I could probably fit more if I really wanted to! I added a bunch of the pins and buttons I had collected up and added them on! I'm really excited about it since I've never done that before, this is my first time really putting pins ALL over anything :'D I'm normally too anxious, but I did it this time, and I'm so happy with it!! I wanna get more pins related to my current interests, but I still love these :3</p>

                </div>
                <p>I've been looking forward to getting this for a WHIIIILE now, so I'm super happy with this! I feel like I'm getting repetitive but UGH it's so fun!!!! I love it sm :33</p>
                <p>Anyways, I think I like this format! In my last pup page/puppypost, I said I would use this blog thing to show off my collection of puppy stuff, soooo yeah! I like getting to be super excited about this, and getting to ramble and stuff!!</p>
                <p>Also, I didn't wanna make a full page about it, BUT I wanna mention that I got a dog tag as well! Like, a real metal one with the laser etching!! I got one of my names on the front, and it says 143 on the back! I used a sharpie to make said etching a bit darker, and I've been wearing it for a bit, and it's SO COOL!!! I jingle when I walk!! I felt a little awkward wearing it outside for the first time, but I got used to it pretty quick, and AAAAAAAA HARMLESS JOY FOR THE WIN!!!!</p>
                <p>Soooo yes, pawprint bag, dog tag, puppy stuff collection!! I don't know what I'm gonna be getting next, but I'll definitely be yapping about it here when I figure it out! See you next time!</p>
