                <p>Hello! It's been a bit, so I wanted to give a bit of an update.</p>
                <p>I've been thinking a lot, and I'm realizing that alterhumanity isn't really for me in the sense that I previously thought - it's definitely valid and I have nothing against it!! It's just not for me right now. I'm not and was never a therian - if I was, I wouldn't be able to say something like that. However, as funlinking is voluntary, I am voluntarily putting that on pause for the time being. I still like puppies and the aesthetic of course, but it's been on the backburner for me recently, and I don't think it's accurate to say I'm funlinked to puppies anymore, much less a specific breed. (I still think sheltie puppies are adorable though.)</p>
                <p>It's less that it's not for me and more that it's not for me right now - I legitimately need to figure out some things about myself as a person, and I think it'd be easier to do that as a human, I suppose? I still like the aesthetic and the idea, so I suppose one could consier me an aeslinker, but the degree of separation is big enough that I'm comfortable saying I'm not a -linker of any kind right now. I'd still consider myself kemonomimi/furry to some degree, in that I'm still 100% sure that my quality of life would improve if I got dog ear attachments for my headphones, it's just not for the same reasons.</p>
                <p>That said, this site is still staying up, and I'll still come in with the occasional update when I get new fun things and have more stuff to show!! I'll probably be leaving a webring I joined for alterhumanity reasons, but aside from that, nothing else should be changing as far as this site is concerned :3 See you next time!</p>
