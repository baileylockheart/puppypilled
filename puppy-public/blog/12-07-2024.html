                <p>hihiiii :3 this is my first blog post!</p>
                <p>I'm here to complain about something, actually :< as I'm sure you can tell, I've been somewhat fixated on puppies/dogs/pawprints recently, and they make me super happy!! Broadly, it's harmless fun, and specifically, I'm exploring a <a target="_blank" href="https://alterhumanity.fandom.com/wiki/Funlink">funlink</a> to sheltie puppies, so there's even more reason for it to make me happy.</p>
                <div class="twosides">
                    <p class="left">Because of all that stuff, I've been trying to collect stuff reminiscent of the,, aesthetic? The vibe? Probably both. Notably, my family knows and approves of the recent puppy obsession! Like, my mom's been into making things with resin, and she let me have a resin dog tag!! I stuck it on a choker and it sparks joy :3</p>
                    <img class="right" src="/images/blog/resin-tag.jpg" alt="resin dog tag on a choker">
                </div>
                <p>BUT BACK TO COMPLAINING!!! I wanted to complain, that was the whole point of making this, so it's time to do that „Éæ(`„Éò¬¥)ÔæâÔæû</p>
                <p>I ordered a package a while back! Specifically, I ordered a bag with pawprints and stars on it!! I thought it as super cute, and I wanted to get a bag that <i>wasn't</i> leather, so I could put pins in it without being nervous about it! I also bought my first ever pride pin, a nice heart-shaped trans pin! It took a lot of debating, since I have a bit of anxiety about buying things, but I'm overall happy with the purchase...</p>
                <p>In concept. In concept, I'm happy with it. However.</p>
                <img src="/images/blog/my-order.png" width="100%" alt="A problem occurred with my order of a trans pride pin and a sling bag with a pawprint pattern">
                <p>I got the notification today that something happened, and OHHHH BOY that makes me nervous. I couldn't really find more details about what <i>kind</i> of problem it was, so I'm even MORE anxious about it!! I'm hoping it's a sort of delay and not like... An explosion? I know that's sort of a jump, though if it WAS an explosion, I hope everyone's okay ^^; again, I know it probably wasn't, but the lack of detail as to what kind of problem there was makes me nervous.</p>
                <p>I'm now realizing that this reads more like me expressing concern than complaining, but I'm definitely complaining, trust me  ‡´Æ‚Ä¢ÃÄ‚§ô‚Ä¢ÃÅ ·Éê I've literally been running around my house to find all the fun pins and buttons I want to put on the bag when it gets here, so the idea of it being delayed, or worse, not coming at all??? not fun :<</p>
                <p>Still though, whatever happens, I'll probably make another pup page if/when it gets here... maybe I'll use this blog thing to show off my puppy-themed stuff as my collection grows :0</p>
                <p>yeeeaaaah, I like that idea! Well, in that case, I'll be back when I get some more stuff ^^ See you next time!</p>
